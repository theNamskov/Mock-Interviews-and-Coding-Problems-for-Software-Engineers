/**
* @brief Gets all prime numbers ranging from 0 to a given boundary
*
* This function uses the sieve of Eratosthenes and the queue data structure.
* An array of all integers from 0 to the given boundary is generated with an assumption that all a prime numbers.
* Knowing that the integer 2 is the first prime number, all multiples of it from 0 to the given boundary are can-
* celled out. Any integer not cancelled out is a prime and hence stored in a queue. The process is repeated for
* all non-cancelled integers.
* Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: O(n)
*
* @param boundary - long long
*
* @return prime_numbers - std::queue<long long>
